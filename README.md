This Gnome Shell Extension converts the normal clock to a duodecimal/dozenal one like the one you can see here:

## Installation

The easiest way to install the dozenal clock and stay up-to-date is using [Gnome Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org).
You can find this extension [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1448/dozenal-clock/).

You can also install it manually. Navigate to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` (per-user) or to `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions` or `/usr/local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` (systemwide) and extract the archive into it. [Source](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell/Extensions)

It is recommended to enable seconds for the clock in GNOME Tweak Tool to improve the accuracy of the dozenal clock.
